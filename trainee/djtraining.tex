\chapter{Becoming a DJ at WITR}

DJs are the face of WITR's whole operation, and are the gatekeepers of our
on-air broadcasts.  WITR's weekly show schedule consists of live DJing from
students and community members, who all bring their own diverse tastes in music
and styles to the table.  DJing allows members to discover new music, improve
communication skils, and represent WITR as an organization.  Running the board
is truly a lot of fun, but keep in mind that it also requires preparation and
passion.  This manual will help you to prepare for the responsibilities that a
DJ has at WITR.

The process to become a DJ at WITR consists of several steps, through which your
trainer will guide you:

Shadowing a DJ is meant to introduce you to some of our DJs and to let you
decide whether or not you want to become a DJ at WITR yourself.  After
shadowing, if you have decided that DJing is something you want to pursue, you
must first pass the All Member Test before you can begin training.  DJing is a
privilege, reserved strictly for members of the station.  Once you are
officially a member, the Program Director will pair you with one of our seasoned
DJ trainers.  Your trainer will work with you for one hour sessions once a week
to develop your skills and get you into the groove of DJing.

When they feel you are ready, your trainer will arrange for you to take our
written DJ test.  Everything that will be on the test can be found in this
manual, although you will likely find that after working with your trainer for
several weeks, you will know most of the information already.

Upon passing this test, you will DJ for several one hour, supervised shows to
demonstrate that DJing has become second nature to you.  You can then schedule a
time and day with your trainer to record a two hour DJ demo.  Your trainer will
supervise the Underground feed from the station office, but you will DJ alone in
the studio for these hours.  The Program Director will then review your demo and
grade your performance based on a rubric derived from this training manual,
which takes into account your timing, style, transitions, and more.

After passing your demo, you will officially be authorized to DJ on air in
Studio X!

\chapter{Programming}

We are a proudly versatile station in terms of programming.  While WITR 89.7 is
primarily an indie-based station, we also broadcast a variety of genre-specific
specialty shows in addition to shows that feature local artists, artist
interview pieces, sports commentary, and weekly news.  As a DJ, you will have
many opportunities to discover new music and make your Pulse of Music show
unique to you.  No two DJs are quite the same in their musical style choices,
and our listeners get to experience a diverse range of genres as a result.
