# Manuals

[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-link]

This repository contains our organization's training manuals:
* All Member Manual &mdash; general information about the station that every
member should know
* DJ Trainee Manual &mdash; a guide to help new DJs learn how to operate our
equipment
* DJ Trainer Manual &mdash; a guide to help existing DJs train new ones

## Motivation

We wanted to upgrade from exporting Word documents as PDFs, and one of our
members volunteered to typeset the manuals in LaTeX.  The manuals looked better,
but some members were concerned about the sustainability of this project &mdash;
not everybody knows how to use LaTeX.

To mitigate those concerns, we're publishing the manuals on GitHub and compiling
them using TravisCI.  We're also making sure to extensively comment the manuals
as a reference for future maintainers who will need to dig through what's
already here and make changes.  By offloading the compilation to &lsquo;The
Cloud,&rsquo; we remove the largest stumbling block to using LaTeX: installing
it.  Internally documenting the manuals helps soften the second largest
stumbling block to using LaTeX: learning how to use it.

## Contributing

If you're part of [WITR](https://witr.rit.edu), please feel free to make a pull
request with any updates to the manuals.  Someone on the engineering staff will
review and merge your PR.

If you're just a passer-by, we welcome your contributions too!  Have you spotted
a typo?  Are you a fellow radio engineer who's noticed something inaccurate
(legally or otherwise)?  Do you want some way to justify your English degree?
Drop us a PR, and we'll gladly consider your input.
