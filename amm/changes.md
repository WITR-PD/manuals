# Things I Changed in the AMM

* The AMM test is on paper in the station, not on a computer
* The transmitter remote is irrelevant (in list of locations)
* §2.3: Trainees can't operate transmitter equipment. Wording changed to On-Air
* §2.11: Changed wording from "no tolerance" to "zero tolerance," which I feel
  is more clear
* §2.12: Nobody can turn off the transmitter who isn't in Engineering, so I've
  changed the wording to "If this is unavailable, you must notify the Chief
  Engineer immediately"
* §3.9: It's actually not illegal to acknowledge an EAS alert on air, but it is
  against WITR policy
* §4.8: Slightly reworded the last paragraph so that the line wasn't too long.
  "The length of the suspension shall be defined, but is left to the discretion
  of the officer."
* I ran PNGCrush on the images, reducing them from JPEG files of ~10MB to PNG
  files of ~200KB, without reducing quality. This doesn't need to go on the
  test, I just thought it would be neat to know.

# Questions

* Is it e-board or E-board? (lowercase e)
* Eric, Steve, and Tim: What are your WITR emails? (All good)
* What do we do about the section full of transmitter operation information?
  (Future plans)
